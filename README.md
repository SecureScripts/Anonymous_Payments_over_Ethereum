# Anonymous_Payments_over_Ethereum

This repository contains the full implementation and experimental framework used in the paper:

**F. Buccafurri, V. De Angelis, S. Lazzaro**  
*Network-Layer Anonymous Payments over Ethereum via Cover Transactions*, TO APPEAR, 2025.  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The project introduces the first payment protocol that achieves network-layer payer anonymity against a global passive traffic observer, while remaining compatible with Ethereum and economically viable under realistic conditions.

This repository allows you to:
- Reproduce all experiments and figures from the paper  
- Deploy and test the smart contracts implementing ring-based anonymous payments  
- Explore the effect of cooperation levels, bus frequencies, gas costs, and deposit configurations  
- Study the incentive model and cost–latency trade-offs
