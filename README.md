# Anonymous_Payments_over_Ethereum

This repository contains the full implementation and experimental framework used in the paper:

**F. Buccafurri, V. De Angelis, S. Lazzaro**  
*Network-Layer Anonymous Payments over Ethereum via Cover Transactions*, TO APPEAR, 2025.

The repository provides:
- A simulator implementing the anonymous payment protocol described in the paper  
- Execution-based smart contract gas-cost profiling using Ganache  
- Preprocessing tools for user payment datasets  
- Automated simulation campaigns  
- Plot generation scripts that reproduce all figures in the publication

## Requirements

- Python **3.10+**
- Ganache (CLI or GUI)
- Node.js (optional, only if installing Ganache CLI)
- Python packages (installed via `requirements.txt`)

---

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate        # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
```

Ensure Ganache is running and its RPC URL matches the one defined in `Parameters.py`.

## Usage

The complete workflow consists of three stages:

1. Pre-compute required CSV input files  
2. Run the main simulation  
3. Generate the plots used in the paper  

### 1. Pre-compute Input Data

#### 1.1 Average gas & Ether prices (Price_Estimate)

```bash
cd Price_Estimate
python Average_wei_dollars_estimation.py
```

This script reads:
- `export-AvgGasPrice.csv`
- `export-EtherPrice.csv`

and computes the average USD cost per gas unit.

#### 1.2 Smart contract gas-cost profiling (Ganache)

```bash
cd Data_for_simulation/Extract_Blockchain_Operation_Cost
python GanacheSimulationCosts.py
```

Output:
```
FINAL_RES.csv
```

This file is used by the simulator to model realistic blockchain execution costs.

#### 1.3 Payment dataset preprocessing

```bash
cd Data_for_simulation/Extract_User_Payments_Data
python <TODO: dataset_processing_script>.py
```

This step must generate a file similar to:

```
Data_for_simulation/UserPayments/output_selection_2020/filtered_dataset.csv
```

which is consumed by `SuperMain.py`.

---

### 2. Run the Main Simulation

This is the core experiment campaign.

```bash
cd Simulation/Blockchain_BUS
python SuperMain.py
```

Output:
```
simulation_results.csv
```

This file contains:
- Mean waiting times
- Expenses of cooperative users
- Expenses of non-cooperative users
- Theoretical deposit values
- All aggregated statistics for plotting

---

### 3. Generate Final Plots

```bash
cd Final_Plots
python Extract_Plots.py
```

This script reads `simulation_results.csv` and produces all figures in the paper.

Plots are saved in:

```
Final_Plots/
```

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Compute USD/gas conversion
cd Price_Estimate
python Average_wei_dollars_estimation.py

# 2) Compute smart contract gas costs (requires Ganache)
cd ../Data_for_simulation/Extract_Blockchain_Operation_Cost
python GanacheSimulationCosts.py

# 3) Prepare payment dataset
cd ../Extract_User_Payments_Data
python <TODO: dataset_processing_script>.py

# 4) Run full simulation
cd ../../Simulation/Blockchain_BUS
python SuperMain.py

# 5) Generate final plots
cd ../../Final_Plots
python Extract_Plots.py
```
